# End to End ML Project with Mr. Krish Naik

## Student Performance Indicator
### Life cycle of Machine learning Project
1. Understanding the Problem Statement
2. Data Collection
3. Data Checks to perform
4. Exploratory data analysis
5. Data Pre-Processing
6. Model Training
7. Choose best model

1) Problem statement
This project understands how the student's performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch and Test preparation course.

3) Data Collection
Dataset Source - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977
The data consists of 8 column and 1000 rows.

#### Dataset information
- gender : sex of students -> (Male/female)
- race/ethnicity : ethnicity of students -> (Group A, B,C, D,E)
- parental level of education : parents' final education ->(bachelor's degree,some college,master's degree,associate's degree,high school)
- lunch : having lunch before test (standard or free/reduced)
- test preparation course : complete or not complete before test
- math score
- reading score
- writing score

 ### Data Checks to perform
- Check Missing values
- Check Duplicates
- Check data type
- Check the number of unique values of each column
- Check statistics of data set
- Check various categories present in the different categorical column


## Conclusions
Student's Performance is related with lunch, race, parental level education. Females lead in pass percentage and also are top-scorers. Student's Performance is not much related with test preparation course. Finishing preparation course is benefitial.
